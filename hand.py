		# this is gonna be the hard algorithm
		# list of all posible poker hands
		# royal flush, straight flush, Quads, full house, flush, straight, trips, two pair, pair, high card

		# giving all these hand strengths a number, would be 10, 9, 8, 7, .... , 1

		# royal flush = 10, straight flush = 9, quads = 8, full house = 7, flush = 6
		# straight = 5, trips = 4, two pair = 3, pair = 2, high card = 1

		# for eample, quads should have a weighting of 8, but because quad Aces should beat quad 2s, we gotta ensure that the Aces beat the 2's each time

		# this is easy, as every hand is ranked by its highest card
		# I am thinking of assigning the quad aces a weighting of 8.14 (as the ace is equivilant to a 14), and the quad 2's a weighting of 8.02
		# giving each card a weight of Ace = 14, King = 13, .... Two = 2, we can try to assign decimal point weights
		# Ace only counts as a low card in one specific straight, so we can treat it as 14 with no wories

		# also have to handle whether that 5th card will be the tiebreaker,
		# so 7 7 7 7 2 would lose to 7 7 7 7 King
		# and the hand strength would look like 8.0702 and 8.0713 respectively

		# a similar method can be used with all other hands.
		# a flush of Ace King 10 7 2 would have a strength of 6.1413100702

		# a high card hand of Ace King 10 7 6 would have a strength of 1.1413100706

		#this way hand strengths can be compared by a simple comparison

		# the good news for these decimal point weights, you just mulitply the rank of the card by 10^(-x) and add it to the running weight
